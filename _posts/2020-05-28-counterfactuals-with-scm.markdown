The basic counterfactual entity in structural models is the sentence: "Y would be y had X been x in unit (or situation) U = u"

To model an action do(X = x) one performs a "mini-surgery" on the causal model, that is, a minimal change necessary for establishing the antecedent X=x, while leaving the rest of the model intact.

Aim for a small set of equations. Identify the least important features that have a direct impact on the target and remove them from the analysis
Run counterfactuals with SCMs; note the counterfactuals effects will be propagated through the graph
Counterfactual "strength" will drive "feature importance"
