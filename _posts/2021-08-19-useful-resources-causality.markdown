Recognising true causal relationships is crucial in shaping effective interventions in medicine, policy-making, and business. Often randomised control trials aren't possible, and we need to deduce causality just from observed data. In such cases, the widely known principle that [correlation doesn't imply causation](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) comes to life. 

Below is a collection of resources to learn more about causality. 

### Causality 101
If you have enough time on your hands, you can go directly to Judea Pearl's seminal [Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference](https://yzhu.io/courses/core/reading/04.causality.pdf). It's quite heavy on theory but very comprehensive. 
For a more relaxed reading, you can check out [The Book of Why](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/) by Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie.

[A nice overview](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10500.pdf) which gives a bird-eye view on causality in ML, and raises some hard open questions.

### Bayesian Networks
