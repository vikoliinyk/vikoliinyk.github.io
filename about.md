I'm a technologist committed to building responsible AI.

I've spent the last 5 years at the London office of [QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/how-we-help-clients), where I worked as a Data Scientist solving clients' most challenging problems across different industries and countries. Some of my favourite projects include building an AI assistant for an international space agency and using highly explainable models to help doctors better cure a severe chronic disease. 

In 2019, I initiated and led an effort centered around [intersectional fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01468). Since then, I have served as an R&D Lead for Fairness & Ethics in AI at QuantumBlack. Recently, I've been part of the Generative AI lab at [QuantumBlack Labs](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/labs), where I led the development of an engine for responsible content generation for retail banking using LLMs.

Before joining QuantumBlack, I interned at [Tinyclues](https://www.tinyclues.com/),a Paris-based startup that enables B2C organisations to run intelligent marketing campaigns, where I was working on improving the existing predictive framework. I developed an LSTM model with attention mechanism and focused on reducing the dimensionality of feature conjunctions using factorisation machine techniques.

<h3>Educational background</h3>
My background is in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I graduated from [Higher School of Economics](https://cs.hse.ru/en/) and Univeristé Paris-Est under [Bézout Excellence track](https://labex-bezout.fr/masters-scholarships/) (first class honours, with distinction).

While at Higher School of Economics, I worked with [Prof. Fuad Aleskerov](https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/faleskerov) on mathematical modelling of political bodies such as Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine as a Research Assistant at the [International Centre of Decision Choice and Analysis](https://www.hse.ru/en/DeCAn/).

Currently, I'm pursuing an MBA degree at the University of Oxford and servCing as a Director at the [Oxford Seed Fund](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/research/centres-and-initiatives/entrepreneurship-centre/oxford-seed-fund), Europes' largest student-led VC fund (£2.5m of capital) that supports early-stage Oxford-affiliated startups.
